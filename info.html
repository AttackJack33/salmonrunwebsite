        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Jack K and I am currently taking a Web Design course through high school. Though this isn't an assignment of some sorts, it is a personal project</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Why did I make this?</h1>
        <p>I am what one might say, an enthusiast, about Splatoon&#8482;. 
        Ever since I've seen the original 
        trailers for 1 and 2, I've wanted to play it for so long. 
        When I got my first switch back in 2017, I got Splatoon 2 
        and played through it like it was nothing. It wasn't until 
        the Action Vs. Comedy Splatfest when I started playing online. 
        Once I did, I invested a lot of time into Salmon Run, mastering it's
        mechanics and how it works. It wasn't until I found Hazmy's channel 
        when I found out that there was a whole community that was dedicated to 
        finding data for everyone, specifically the Salmon Run Reports. It wasn't until 
        his discord got raided and decided to stop doing Salmon Run Reports. So I decided 
        to take it into my own hands. With the info gathered from the reports and the data 
        of each weapon uploaded on <a href="https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Inkpedia</a>, 
        I managed to create this website for everyone to look into and learn more about Salmon Run.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>"I have a question but it's not listed here"</h1>
        <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me, I am very open to suggestions 
        and I will take any help I can get. If you noticed I forgot something, again, feel free to email me. 
        </p>

        <h1>QA</h1>
        <p>"Can I be a part of this?"</p>
        <p>No, as much as I would like some help, I would like to take pride in making this myself as it is 
        my first big project, contributions sent through email will be credited in the code though.
        </p>
        <p>"How can I help?"</p>
        <p>By emailing me! Emailing me with info you think will help me will be greatly appreciated and won't 
        go unnoticed (unless my inbox is completely filled with contributions which in that case I'm sorry if I
        miss an email.)
